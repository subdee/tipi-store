> [!WARNING]
> This is first and foremost a personal app store created mostly to complement the main app store with self hosted apps
> that I use myself.
> Apps I use regularly will get regular updates, as much as I can.
> If I stop using an app, I will keep it in the store but I would rely on PRs to keep them updated.
