# Calibre-Web Automated _(formerly Calibre-Web Automator)_

## Making Calibre-Web your _dream_, all-in-one self-hosted digital library solution.

## Why does it exist? 🔓

Calibre, while a fantastic tool for its age, has several problems when containerised, including its reliance on a
KasmVNC server instance for the UI, which is near impossible to use on mobile and is relatively resource-heavy if you're
running a small, lower power server like I am.

For many, Calibre-Web has really swooped in to save the day, offering an alternative to a containerised Calibre instance
that's resource-light and with a much more modern UI to boot.

However, when compared to full-fat Calibre, it unfortunately lacks a few core features leading many to run both services
in parallel, each serving to fill in where the other lacks, resulting in an often clunky, imperfect solution.

## Goal of the Project 🎯

Calibre-Web Automated aims to be an all-in-one solution, combining the modern lightweight web UI from Calibre-Web with
the robust, versatile feature set of Calibre, with a slew of extra features and automations thrown in on top.
