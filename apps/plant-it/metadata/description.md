<p align="center"><i><b>[Project under "active" development, some features may be unstable or change in the future. A first release version is planned to be packed soon].</b></i></p>
<p align="center">Plant-it is a <b>self-hosted gardening companion app.</b><br>Useful for keeping track of plant care, receiving notifications about when to water plants, uploading plant images, and more.</p>


## Why?
Plant-it is a gardening companion app that helps you take care of your plants.

It does not recommend you about which action to take, instead it is designed to log the activity you are doing.
This is on purpose, I strongly believe that the only one in charge of knowing when to water your plants, when to fertilize them, etc. is you (with the help of multiple online sources).

Plant-it helps you remember the last time you did a treatment of your plants, which plants you have, collects photos of your plants, and notifies you about the time passed since the last action on them.


## Features highlight
* Add existing plants or user created plants to your collection
* Log events like watering, fertilizing, biostimulating, etc. for your plants
* View all the logged events, filtering by plant and event type
* Upload photos of your plants
* Set reminders for some actions on your plants (e.g. notify if not watered every 4 days)
