## Introduction

**Papra** is a minimalistic document management and archiving platform. It is designed to be simple to use and
accessible to everyone. Papra is a platform for long-term document storage and management, like a digital archive for
your documents.

Forget about that receipt of that gift you bought for your friend last year, or that warranty for your new phone. With
Papra, you can easily store, forget, and retrieve your documents whenever you need them.

A live demo of the platform is available at [demo.papra.app](https://demo.papra.app) (no backend, client-side local
storage only).
